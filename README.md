# Ruby

This repository contains all the Ruby projects I've created over the past couple of years.  Most titles will be self-explanatory.

### Prerequisites

Most of these projects were made within RubyMine but that shouldn't matter.  Nothing was made with Ruby 2.2 or below.

## Contents:

### CIS 282 - Ruby I (Autumn 2018)

This was my first foray into Ruby after being introduced to C# the previous quarter.  The class final project was a Connect Four game which I made three versions.  Player vs Computer, Player vs Player, and Computer vs Computer.  The computer player just drops a random piece, there is no logic to its moves.

### CIS 283 - Ruby II (Spring 2019)

I took this class three months after the first one finished.  The class final was a PDF Crossword Puzzle Generator.  You supply a text document with words separated by lines (\n).

### CIS 272  - Agile Development (Winter 2020)

In one of my final classes we spent some time learning test driven development in Ruby.  The Puzzle Test was the final project and I had to create the tests and the application based off of instructions describing the functionality of the game and all of its methods.
