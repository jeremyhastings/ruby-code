sample-ruby
===========

Sample ruby coding - using the core libraries only (ie. no gems).  All times should be in UTC.

The idea is to see how you write ruby and how you think about solving problems.  The majority of these tests are real problems taken from our existing codebase.  Code reuse where appropriate is encouraged.

Tests are in `spec/your_ruby_spec.rb` and the implementation will go to `lib/your_ruby.rb`

Please add further tests where appropriate.

You can use the repl script to run IRB on your_ruby.rb .

- fizzbuzz - takes an integer as the argument and then returns an array of results up to that number.

- smallest_rectangle_of_aspect - takes an aspect ratio (height/width) and a rectangle (array [width, height]) and works out the smallest rectangle of that aspect ratio that contains a rectangle of those dimensions.

- parse_time - takes a string in the form HH:MM and works out how many seconds into the day it is.

- finish_time_for_day / start_time_for_day - takes a date/time object and a hash in the form { day => [starts, ends], ... }, where day is the abbreviated english name for the day, starts and ends are times in the format accepted by parse_time.  It returns the start/finish time as a time object for that day.

- calculate_completion_time - takes a time, a number of hours (num_hours) and a hash of opening hours.  If I place my order at placed_at time, then this returns the earliest point at which (1) the shop is open and (2) has been open for a total of num_hours since I placed my order.  So if I place my order 1 hour before closing time and it takes 2 hours to process, then this will rollover 1 hour into the next working day.

- duckduckwhy - this scrapes duckduckgo.com to get the first N results for the specified phrase, using Net::HTTP.
